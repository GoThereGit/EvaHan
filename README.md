# Data
The Evahan 2026 data set consists of three datasets, covering English, the Complete Library of the Four Treasures, and Tibetan Buddhist canon text-image data. The data underwent an initial phase of automatic annotation, followed by meticulous correction and refinement by experts in ancient Chinese language and history to ensure the highest quality for both training material and gold-standard texts.

- **Dataset A** is a collection of PDF books from the Internet Archive, converted to .tiff format. It is based on real text and is constructed from Project Gutenberg e-books. The dataset contains scanned pages from 10 specific English books.

- **Dataset B** is selected from the Sikuquanshu (Complete Library of Chinese Classics), which contains data on four ancient books: Classics, History, Philosophy, and Anthology, as well as various other ancient book data.

- **Dataset C** consists of Chinese Tripitaka data, including the Korean Tripitaka, the Chinese Tripitaka (TKH) dataset, and the Chinese Multi-Tripitaka (MTH) dataset.
